# Blockchain

This repository contains various Blockchain Projects created using Smart Contracts in Solidity.
All the projects were run on the Ethereum Ubuntu Virtual Machine.

## Decentralized Applications

Decentralized applications are a piece of so ware that communicates with the blockchain, which manages the state of all network actors. The DApps that I created are as follows:

* [Auction](https://github.com/SwethaVipparla/Blockchain/tree/master/Decentralized%20Applications/Auction%20Project)
* [Ballot](https://github.com/SwethaVipparla/Blockchain/tree/master/Decentralized%20Applications/Ballot%202)
* [Coin](https://github.com/SwethaVipparla/Blockchain/tree/master/Decentralized%20Applications/Coin)

## Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The smart contracts that I created are:

* [Inbox](https://github.com/SwethaVipparla/Blockchain/blob/master/Smart%20Contracts/inbox/contracts/Inbox.sol)
* [Lottery](https://github.com/SwethaVipparla/Blockchain/blob/master/Smart%20Contracts/lottery/contracts/Lottery.sol)
* [Campaign](https://github.com/SwethaVipparla/Blockchain/blob/master/Smart%20Contracts/kickstart/ethereum/contracts/Campaign.sol)
